title: "Hey, We're Lee-One Your Design & Development Team"
description: 'We are a two-person design and development team that works side by side from idea to final product. By combining Product Design and Software Engineering, we create experiences that are both meaningful for users and technically robust. In our team, design is not just about visual aesthetics; it is a deliberate process grounded in user needs, product logic, and real-world development constraints. Likewise, engineering is not just about writing code; it is about turning ideas into stable, scalable, and reliable products. We believe the best products are created at the intersection of design thinking and engineering excellence.'
